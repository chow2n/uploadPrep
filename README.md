# uploadPrep

This is a quick Python script that automated some of the tasks that were required to upload documents to our application. All this script does is create some folders, copy some files to another location, and create a CSV of the copied files. Eventually, I would like to implement some kind of config file to allow for more customization of the CSV file.
